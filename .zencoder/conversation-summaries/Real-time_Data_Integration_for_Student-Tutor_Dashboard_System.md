now i want all the data to be correct. dont use the mock data. use the realtime data for both dashboards. when the student uploads the assignment, the touter should receive the tasks. make all the updates to work as requested. make the payment gateways to work, the payment should be shown in thetouter and all the other staff. make it work with real time data

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on converting a student-tutor assignment management system from using mock data to real-time database integration. The main objective was to ensure that when students upload assignments, tutors receive them immediately, and all payment processing works with live data across both dashboards.

**Key Technical Implementations:**

1. **Database Schema Corrections**: Fixed field name inconsistencies between the frontend and backend. The Order schema used `userId` while frontend code expected `student`, requiring updates to populate queries and display logic in the tutor dashboard.

2. **Real-time Data Flow**: Implemented automatic data refresh mechanisms with 30-second intervals on both student and tutor dashboards to ensure real-time updates. Added periodic refresh calls to `fetchHomework()`, `updateDashboardOverview()`, `loadAssignments()`, and `loadPendingPayments()`.

3. **Payment System Integration**: Fixed payment record creation by correcting schema field names from `userId` to `user` in Payment model references. Updated payment proof submission endpoints and ensured proper balance tracking for students.

4. **Balance Notification System**: Created `checkBalanceNotification()` function that monitors orders with "checking-balance" status and displays notifications when student balance is insufficient for pending assignments.

5. **Server-side Notifications**: Added comprehensive console logging for real-time monitoring of system activities including new assignment submissions, payment approvals, and assignment completions with detailed information for tutors.

6. **API Endpoint Enhancements**: Added complete tutor management endpoints including `/tutor/profile`, `/tutor/assignments`, `/tutor/students`, `/tutor/pending-payments`, and payment approval/rejection functionality.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed mongoose population queries to use correct field names (`userId` instead of `student`)
- Corrected payment schema field references throughout the codebase
- Resolved undefined values in API responses by ensuring proper data population
- Fixed real-time data flow between student submissions and tutor dashboard visibility

**Testing and Validation**: Created comprehensive test scripts (`test-realtime.js` and `test-api.js`) to verify the real-time functionality works correctly. Tests confirmed that student assignments appear immediately in tutor dashboards and payment submissions are properly tracked.

**Current Status**: The system now successfully operates with real-time data integration. Students can submit assignments that immediately appear in tutor dashboards, payment processing works with live database records, and both dashboards refresh automatically to show current data. The server provides detailed logging for monitoring all system activities.
